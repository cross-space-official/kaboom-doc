# KaBoom Frontend Architecture Documentation

## Overview

KaBoom Frontend is a modern web application built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. It leverages various libraries and tools to create a responsive and efficient user interface for the KaBoom platform.

## Key Technologies

1. React
2. TypeScript
3. Vite
4. Tailwind CSS
5. React Query
6. Axios
7. i18next
8. React Router
9. Zustand



## Key Features

### API Integration

The project uses OpenAPI Generator to create TypeScript types and API client code based on the backend API specification. This ensures type safety and consistency between the frontend and backend.

### Routing

React Router is used for handling navigation within the application. The main routing setup can be found in the App.tsx file.

### State Management

Zustand is used for global state management, providing a simple and efficient solution for managing application state.

### Internationalization

i18next is integrated for handling multiple languages. The application supports dynamic language switching.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to CSS. Custom styles are defined in the src/index.css file.

### PWA Support

The application is configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using the vite-plugin-pwa plugin. This enables features like offline support and installability on mobile devices.

### Code Splitting

The application uses dynamic imports and the vite-plugin-chunk-split plugin to optimize bundle sizes and improve loading performance.

## Development Workflow

The project uses pnpm for package management.

Development server can be started using pnpm dev.

Production builds are created using pnpm build.

The project includes ESLint and TypeScript for code quality and type checking.

## Deployment

The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. There are separate Dockerfiles for production and staging environments.

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions are used for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/develop.yml file, which builds the Docker image and updates the GitOps repository for deployment.



## Performance Considerations

The application uses code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.

React Query is used for efficient data fetching and caching.

The PWA configuration enables offline support and improves load times for returning users.

## Security Considerations

The application uses HTTPS for all API communications.

Sensitive information is not stored in the frontend code.

The project is configured to work with Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
